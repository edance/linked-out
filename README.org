* Linked Out
The goal of this project is to simply look at different people's linkedin accounts.

** Constraints
- Can only view 200 profiles per day. We should go significantly less to start out.
- We only want to view a profile once every *four* months.
- We want to dynamically be able to add new search terms for a user.

** Schema
*** SearchTerms
| field | type   | purpose        | example             |
|-------+--------+----------------+---------------------|
| name  | string | store the term | "software engineer" |

*** Profiles
| field               | type      | purpose                          | example       |
|---------------------+-----------+----------------------------------+---------------|
| name                | string    | full name of the person          | "Evan Dancer" |
| uid                 | string    | linkedin id for the profile      | ???           |
| connection_distance | integer   | 1st, 2nd, 3rd degree connections | 3rd           |
| created_at          | datetime  | when they were viewed            |               |
| search_term_id      | reference |                                  |               |

** Additional

*** Randomizer
To not look super sketch, I will want to do some random mouse movements between a lot of actions.
